    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // CHANGES ORIGINAL ARRAY WHEN NEW CONST IS UPDATED
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team); // prints out two sets of arrays

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'; // Reference not copy. This updates the index 3 names but also in the original players array

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // DOES NOT CHANGE ORIGINAL ARRAY
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); // When sliced is passed nothing, it copies the original array. team2 is different but players remains the same

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // DOES NOT CHANGE ORIGINAL ARRAY
    // or use the new ES6 Spread. Spread takes every item out of old array and puts it into a new one.
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'jingle bells'; // Replaces value in team4 but does not change values in players array
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // CHANGES ORIGINAL OBJECT
    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;

    // DOES NOT CHANGE ORIGINAL
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12});
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const piggy = {
        name: 'Miss Piggy',
        age: 25,
        social: {
            twitter: '@misspiggy',

        }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(piggy);

    // Make a copy
    const dev = Object.assign({}, piggy);
    dev.name = 'Kermit';
    // CAREFUL! Object.assign only affects first level so dev.social.twitter will also change original twitter level data
    dev.social.twitter = '@greenfrog';
    console.log(dev);
    console.log(dev.social);
    console.log(piggy.social);

    // Not recommended but possible deep clone method is to convert everything to a string
